## Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filesystem**:
   - Create a `data` folder in your project directory.
   - Add a 320x240 JPEG file named `vanity.jpg` to this folder.
   - Use PlatformIO's "Build Filesystem Image" and "Upload Filesystem Image" to upload the file to SPIFFS.

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Use PlatformIO to upload the firmware to your CYD board.
   - Alternatively, download the precompiled `.bin` file from the [Releases](#) section and flash it using the ESP32 Flash Download Tool.

3. **WiFi Configuration**:
   - If the board is not connected to WiFi, follow these steps:
     - Connect to the ESP32 AP (`ESP32_AP`).
     - Open your browser and go to `192.168.4.1` to configure WiFi.

4. **Start the Frame**:
   - Once connected, the frame will:
     - Display your `vanity.jpg`.
     - Begin the slideshow from the SD card.
     - Play audio files as uploaded.

## Web Interface

Access the web interface at `<device-IP>` (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) to:
- Upload images and audio files
- Adjust slideshow speed
- Trigger audio playback
- Check device status

---

## Preparing Images and Audio

1. **Images**:
   - Resize all images to `320x240` pixels.
   - Save them as `.jpg` files for better performance.

2. **Audio**:
   - Use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to convert audio to `.wav` format for playback.

---

## Advanced Features

- **mDNS**: Access your device via `photoframe.local` without needing the IP address.
- **~~OTA Updates~~**: ~~Update firmware using ElegantOTA by navigating to `/update` on the web interface.~~ *(Not yet implemented)*
- **Customization**: Modify the vanity screen (`vanity.jpg`) for personalized branding.
